# Mars Rover Photo Viewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Using React, I made a website which displays photos takes by the Mars rovers from the NASA Mars Rover Photos open API. The reason
I made this was to develop my skills in web development as well as learn how to use React. This is my first React project.
